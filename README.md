# friseurManager
This is a project made for a database application project course at the University of Helsinki.

## Description
The goal is to crate a friseur salon management application that enables the manager(s) to keep track of friseurs and reservations for services.

Services are presented on a website and it is possible to make reservations from the web. The assortment of services of the friseurs vary and, as such, every friseur is not offering all the services. Prices are based on the service. A customer can reserve an appointment via the web, where they will choose the time, service and friseur, as well as, special arrangements if needed. A customer can register to become a loyaty customer, through which they get a loyaty discount. Even if not registered the reservation is accepted, and the customer will recieve a reservation number by which they can cancel the appointment.
